	<h3>Living Collections of The Morton Arboretum</h3>
		<p>The Morton Arboretum living plant collections represent almost 90 years of plant acquisition and development. Plants in our collections have been acquired from both cultivated and wild sources from around the world, primarily in the northern temperate zone. The goal of collections at the Arboretum is to grow in its collections a broad range of plants native to the temperate regions of the world that can grow in the climate and soils of northern Illinois. The Arboretum maintains almost 4,300 different kinds of plants that are arranged in over 140 collections that have geographic, taxonomic, horticulture, landscape and special habitat themes.</p>
		
		<p>Notable collections of elms, oaks, maples, crabapples, and extensive collections of Chinese, Appalachian, Ozarkian and Midwestern plants of wild collected origin are contained in the 688 hectares (1700 acres) of the Arboretum grounds. Also represented in our collections are accessions acquired from early botanists and plant explorers: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Anderson" target="external">Edgar Anderson<a/> (1897-1969), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Bretschneider" target="external">Emil Vasilievic Bretschneider<a/> (1833-1901), <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ca&u=http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Bush&ei=uUiTTeK7Fcy1twei3PFf&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB4Q7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3DBenjamin%2BFranklin%2BBush%2B%2Bsite:wikipedia.org%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DKxx%26sa%3DX%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divnso" target="external">Benjamin Franklin Bush<a/> (1858-1937), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_C._Deam" target="external">Charles C.

		<p>The Arboretum is committed to advancing the knowledge of plants and conservation. To this end, it is an active member in the North America - China Plant Collections Consortium (NACPEC), the Plant Collecting Collaborative (PCC), and the North American Plant Collections Consortium (NAPCC). As part of these and other organizations, the Arboretum has participated in seed collecting expeditions to China, the Republic of Georgia, the Appalachians, and the Ozarks. Arboretum collecting trips have also gone to the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Black Hills, Great Plains and Midwest. Many plants found in our collections are the results of these collecting trips, and the information about them accessed through this site.</p>
		
		<p><strong>searchMOR</strong> is your portal to information about the source(s) of our plants, the collections in which they grow, collector and expeditions, wild collected site and habitat information, USDA hardiness zones and much more. You can use highlighted links to access information about associated herbarium records and images of individual herbarium sheets from our living collections. You are also able to map a selected plant using a link to our interactive web map. We are in the process of adding images of living plants, and making them available to you. Look for a camera icon <a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/image_browser.php?sciname=1989*0007******7820" target="external"> (<img src="images/AAA-IMAGE-ICON-cam.gif">)<a/> following a plant name to view these images.</p>
