	<h3>Introduction to searchMOR, the <br>Integrated Plants Database of The Morton Arboretum</h3>
		<p>This online database provides integrated access to data on the plants of The Morton Arboretum living collections and herbarium, as well as to our interactive collections map, scanned herbarium sheets, and photographs of living plants.</p>
		<p>This dataset encompasses more than 222,000 live plants representing nearly 4,300 taxa and nearly 60,000 databased herbarium specimens. The system represents an accumulation of living plant and herbarium information dating back to the founding of the Arboretum in 1922.</p>
		<p>What might you do with this database? Here are a few ideas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn where to find a particular species on The Morton Arboretum grounds.</li>
			<li>Get a quick idea of what a plant looks like. Many Arboretum Herbarium specimens have been scanned and images of living plants are available online.</li>
			<li>Learn when plants flower in the Chicago area region. The herbarium specimens have been coded by presence of flowers, fruits, buds, and vegetation. </li>
			<li>Study the distribution of plants in the Chicago area region.  Many of our scientific names have ranges coded, so that you can see roughly what their range is. </li>

		</ul>

		<p>We hope you enjoy the database and find it useful.  <a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/advanced_search.php"> Search the plants database now</a>.</p>
