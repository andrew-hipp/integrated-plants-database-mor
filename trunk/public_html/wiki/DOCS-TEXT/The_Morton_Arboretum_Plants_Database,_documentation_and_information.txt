'''Welcome to the documentation and information pages for [http://quercus.mortonarb.org searchMOR], the Integrated Plants Database of [http://www.mortonarb.org The Morton Arboretum].'''

This site being developed to provide a growing resource for The Morton Arboretum's [http://quercus.mortonarb.org Integrated Plants Database]. It is currently in development. Pages will be added to explain how content is developed and interrelated, and how various features of the database can be used. Examples of different applications of the data will be added. We also intend to use this space as a discussion area for nomenclatural changes in the database, which have a strong impact on what users actually view. For additional information on this site or the database, please contact [http://systematics.mortonarb.org/lab Andrew Hipp], the Arboretum's Plant Systematist and Herbarium Curator.
