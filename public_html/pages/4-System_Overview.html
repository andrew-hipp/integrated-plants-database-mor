<h3>Overview of the Integrated Plants database</h3>
	<p>The <strong><italic>searchMOR</italic></strong> system was developed over a period of three decades at The Morton Arboretum. At its core is information about individual specimens that make up the Arboretum's living and herbarium collections. If you run into questions that are not addressed on these pages, or if you have any comments on the system, please contact <a href="http://systematics.mortonarb.org/lab" target="external">Andrew Hipp</a>, the Arboretum's Plant Systematist and Herbarium Curator or <a href="mailto:ehedborn@mortonarb.org">Ed Hedborn</a>, Manager of Plant Records. </p> <!--We should add a comment form to solicit structured feedback-->
	
<h3>What types of data are in this system?</h3>
	<p>This online database is a portal to data that are housed in the integrated plants database developed at The Morton Arboretum to hold information on plant specimens in the Arboretum's  <a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/?herbarium" target="external">Herbarium</a> and <a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/?living_collections" target="external">Living Collections</a>.</p> The primary types of data in the system are:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Herbarium label data.</strong> Plant collectors who deposit specimens in the herbarium provide a label that indicates who collected the plant, where and when it was collected, what habitat it occupied and what other plants it was growing with, and any other information that might be of interest to researchers, educators, and other herbarium users. (Click <a href="http://redwood.mortonarb.org/images/jpg/sheet/5/0023465MOR.jpg" targe="external">here to see an example herbarium label</a>, and <a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/details_herbarium.php?id=154641" target="external">here to see how the label data look on the database</a>.) These data are entered from the labels by herbarium staff and volunteers. Many herbarium specimens have been scanned, and in those cases images are also available online.</li>
			
		<li><strong>Plant names (nomenclatural data).</strong> The Arboretum works constantly to bring its use of scientific names up to date. The online database provides a snapshot of what our current scientific name use is, as well as plant common names and trademarks, plant family and order names, USDA hardiness zones and plant range information.</li>
				
		<li><strong>Living collections source and grounds data.</strong> The Arboretum acquires plants for the living collections from natural populations, from nurseries, and from other Arboreta and botanical gardens. All plants come in with information about where the plant came from and in what form. Wild-collected plants also include many of the same types of information found on an herbarium label.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Information on where to find the plant.</strong> For living collections plants, many users will want to know where a particular species, cultivar, or specimen grows. All living plants in the collections have grid information that links to an <a href="http://www.plantconservation.us/map.phtml" target="external">interactive map</a>. Click the grid numbers to jump to the map, then zoom in and out to find your plant.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Annotations by experts.</strong> When researchers with particular knowledge of a plant group study our specimens, they often update the identification of the plant, provide new insight into what plant names we should be using, or make comments about the plant specimens that may be of interest to future users. These annotations are entered into our database. For herbarium specimens, we provide information on the last annotation for each specimen (<a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/details_herbarium.php?id=122843" target="external">example</a>). In the living collections, plants that have been marked as "true-to-name" by an expert are indicated by underlined grid coordinates (<a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/details_living_coll.php?id=702-50" target="external">example</a>).</li>
		
		</ul>
	<p>Because many of our herbarium specimens have been collected from plants in the living collections, herbarium and living collections data often link to each other. You can explore the two collections by clicking the red links that take you between the two sides of the system. Click <a href="http://quercus.mortonarb.org/details_living_coll.php?id=702-50" target="external">here</a> for an example of a living collections plant that has been documented by the herbarium several times over two decades.</p>

<h3>How was this system built?</h3> <!--This section should probably go last-->
	<p>The underlying data for living plant collections are contained in the plant records system of the Arboretum which has been kept since 1922. This life history information is contained in accession record books, a large card file system and in original source records like plant invoices, seed exchange booklets, inventories, and planting lists. Beginning in 1985, this system was computerized using information about living plants only. This original database system was built by Jim Leineweber of Auton Corp. and Ed Hedborn and Charles Lewis of the Arboretum. It was designed with four major modules: inventory, history, plant evaluation and propagagion experiments. In 2010, a herbarium module was added by <a href="http://www.pick911.com/" target="external">Bakken Software Services</a>. The present plant records database system was developed using the Unidata database system.</p>
	
	<p>The online database is developed in MySQL with a PHP front-end by <a href="http://lextech.com/" target="external">Lextech Global Services</a>. The online system is a snapshot of the Unidata database, which is updated regularly. All development of the online system was supported by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (<a href="http://www.imls.gov/" target="external">IMLS</a>), through their <a href="http://www.imls.gov/applicants/grants/foramerica.shtm" target="external">Museums for America Program</a>.</p>

<h3>Using searchMOR</h3>
	<p><strong>searchMOR</strong> data can be accessed in a variety of ways. The simplest is by using the quick search fields found in the upper right of your screen. More complicated searches may be made by clicking on the Advanced Search tab. If you need more information about specimens than you can find on the page, or if you want the ability to sort and analyze data, try downloading your search results, which have more information that than is displayed on the screen. Downloading data brings up a text file that can be opened in any spreadsheet application (e.g., Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc). The <strong>Herbarium</strong> tab will introduce you to the Herbarium of The Morton Arboretum, which is the premier repository for specimens documenting the Flora of the Chicago Region. The <strong>Living Collections</strong> tab will introduce you to the extensive living plant collections of The Morton Arboretum. The <strong>System Overview</strong> tab will give you information about the database system itself, its development, and future directions.</p>
	<p>Information contained in this online database is updated periodically from our central plant databases. Because specimens are continually being added to our Herbarium, and plants are being added and removed from our living collections, any catalog quickly becomes out-of-date. Also, our staff is actively reviewing, updating and correcting scientific names. </p>
