	<h3>What is an herbarium?</h3>
		<p>An herbarium is a library of dried plants. Plants are mounted on archival-quality paper, with a label that provides information on where, when, and by whom the plant was collected. Collectors provide detailed locality and habitat information, along with a complete plant specimen. Carefully prepared and handled specimens will last for hundreds of years. The herbarium thus serves as a biodiversity time capsule, and one of our most important tools for studying how the world's biodiversity has changed over time.
		<br><br>
		The Morton Arboretum's herbarium houses more than 169,000 dried plant specimens and 19,000 lichens. Our herbarium's strongest collections are its (1) active and nearly comprehensive contemporary collection of the flora of the 24-county Chicago region and (2) broad collection of woody plants of the northern Temperate zone, both cultivated and spontaneous. These two core collections are databased nearly in their entirety. In this online portal, you can explore the fascinating flora of our region and the changing landscape of the Arboretum's living collections.</p>
	
	<h3>What can you do with an herbarium?</h3>
		<p>Herbarium data allow us to pinpoint where plants have grown, and when they were there. The data available to you in this portal and through other herbaria worldwide can be used in many ways. Here are just three of the many ways that you might use the herbarium and the data presented in this database:
		<ul>
			<li><b title="Bebber, D. P., M. A. Carine, et al. (2010). Herbaria are a major frontier for species discovery. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107(51): 22169-22171.">Discover new species.</b> Scientists estimate that there are perhaps 70,000 flowering plant species unknown to science, and that more than half of those may be lurking in the world's herbaria. Herbarium data on plant distributions and habitats, and careful study of the plant specimens themselves, are crucial in understanding the scope of plant biodiversity worldwide.</li>
			<li><b title="Ahrends, A., C. Rahbek, et al. (2011). Conservation and the botanist effect. Biological Conservation 144(1): 131-140.">Learn to identify plants.</b> Herbaria provide a large and often well studied collection of species. Scans of many of our specimens are available online (look for the camera icon: <img src="images/AAA-IMAGE-ICON-cam.gif">). In a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V5X-511RGV9-1/2/5309a0c82ea98eddecdea9ba6924fd1c" target="external">recent study</a>, researchers found that access to herbaria significantly improves botanists' ability to correctly identify plants, and contributes to a better understanding of local plant biodiversity.</li>
			<li><b title="Miller-Rushing, A. J., R. B. Primack, et al. (2006). Photographs and herbarium specimens as tools to document phenological changes in response to global warming. Am. J. Bot. 93(11): 1667-1674. -- D'Andrea, L., O. Broennimann, et al. (2009). Climate change, anthropogenic disturbance and the northward range expansion of Lactuca serriola (Asteraceae). Journal of Biogeography 36(8): 1573-1587.">Study how global climate change affects plant ranges and life history.</b> As our climate warms and patterns of precipitation change, plant distributions are changing as well. How will this affect what our world looks like in 50 years? Herbaria provide a means to look back into the recent past, and they reveal that plants have responded quite rapidly to climate change.</li>

In the meantime, we hope you enjoy learning more about plants through your studies in the Arboretum's online database.

	<h3>Herbarium contacts and additional information</h3>
		<p>The herbarium depends on our more than 30 active volunteers, who collect plants, mount specimens, file and accession, make labels, enter data, develop databases and aid in nomenclatural research, and assist in many other tasks. The herbarium is a lively and enjoyable place to work. If you are interested in volunteering with us, you can contact:</p>
