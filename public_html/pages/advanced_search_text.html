Advanced searches allow you to choose whether you search the entire collection of plant records (Search Type: Combined)
or separately search the living collections or herbarium data. In general, every blank you fill in will restrict your search:
thus, a search for "Hess" in collector last name with "Ulmus" in the genus will only return elm species that were by a "Hess" (typically,
William Hess, the former herbarium curator). Fields are also typically wildcarded at both ends:
"mo" in Collector first name will return "Morris" or "Raymond" or
any other name with "mo" in it. Click on one of the question marks for a brief help message,
