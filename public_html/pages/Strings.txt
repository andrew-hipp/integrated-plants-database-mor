# This file contains strings that will be used in place of existing strings.
# Any line starting with a hash symbol ('#') like this one will be treated as a comment.
# Blank lines are ignored.
# The left-hand-side of the equals sign is the string to replace, the right-hand-side
# of the equals sign is the string to use in place of the left-hand-side string,
# e.g. if the line contains "normal string" = "new string to view", locations that would
# normally display the string "normal string" (without the quotes) will display as
# "new string to view" (without the quotes).
#
# Note: white space at the beginning and end of strings will be ignored unless the string is
# enclosed in quotes.
